üëã Hello, I'm Christopher ‚Äì Backend Developer.<br>
I'm a passionate Backend Developer with a strong focus on building scalable, secure, and efficient backend systems. My expertise spans across various technologies, including Node.js, Express, MySQL, MongoDB, Sequelize, and JWT, among others. I take pride in creating clean, modular code that provides seamless and efficient solutions to complex problems.

üõ†Ô∏è Skills & Expertise:
Backend Development: Extensive experience with Node.js and Express to create fast and scalable applications. I prioritize building APIs that are easy to use, secure, and maintainable.
Database Management: Skilled in working with both MySQL (relational) and MongoDB (NoSQL). I leverage Sequelize and Mongoose to ensure efficient and streamlined database interactions.
Authentication & Security: Proficient in implementing JWT-based authentication and role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure secure and customizable access to resources.
API Design & Development: I design RESTful APIs that are intuitive, flexible, and perform well under load. My goal is to create an exceptional developer experience for anyone interacting with the API.
User Profile Management: Built robust systems for user registration, login, email verification, password resets, and profile management to ensure smooth user experiences.
